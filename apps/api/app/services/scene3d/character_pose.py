"""The character pose library for the Blender converter, and the constants behind it.

The preview already has a pose library (``characterPose.ts``) that turns an action
into joint angles. Until now the converter had none at all: it read
``kf.position`` and ``kf.rotation_y`` and ignored ``kf.action`` entirely, so under
the DEFAULT ``SCENE3D_RENDERER_BACKEND=blender`` a ``walk`` rendered as a figure
sliding along the ground with its limbs welded in place.

The curves are implemented twice, once per language, for the same reason the
geometry builders are: the two runtimes share nothing. What makes that safe is
that the CONSTANTS live here and reach the frontend through
``app.cli.generate_scene_script_preview_contract``, so neither side hand-maintains
a number, and ``test_character_pose_matches_preview`` compares the two
implementations' actual output phase by phase.

The curve itself, and why it is shaped this way, is documented in
``characterPose.ts``; the short version is that a sine slides the planted foot by
332% of the body's own travel, so the stance leg is linear and only the swing is
eased.
