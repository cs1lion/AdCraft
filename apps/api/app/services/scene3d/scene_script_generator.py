"""Generate SceneScriptRoot from a natural-language scene description.

Two generators back the scene-3d canvas node:

* :class:`LLMSceneScriptGenerator` — the real path. Calls an
  OpenAI-compatible ``/chat/completions`` endpoint (``LLM_BASE_URL`` /
  ``LLM_API_KEY``) through ``httpx``, then validates the reply with the
  scene3d :mod:`parser`.
* :class:`TemplateSceneScriptGenerator` — the deterministic path used in
  fake/mock runtime. Builds a known-good SceneScript from a shot template.

Both generators fail with :class:`SceneScriptGenerationError` (carrying a
machine-readable ``code``) instead of returning a partial script, so the
node executor can fail closed with an explicit error.

Two traps the sizes above imply:
- A `platform` is a raised DECK, not a room. Anything meant to stand beside it
  must sit outside its footprint, or it will be standing underneath the deck.
- Anything whose base is non-zero (`lantern`, `flat_roof`, `rect_table`) is held
  off the ground or stands on legs; `position` places its lowest point, not its
  centre.

You are a professional 3D previsualization artist. Convert the user's scene \
description into ONE SceneScript JSON object for a low-poly 3D previs \
renderer.

Output ONLY the JSON object inside a single ```json code block, no other text. \
The object must follow this shape:
{{
  "scene": {{"name": string, "environment": "indoor" | "outdoor" | "mixed", \
"lighting": "warm" | "cool" | "neutral" | "dramatic" | "soft" | "hard", \

"action": "stand" | "walk" | "sit" | "talk" | "gesture"}}]}},
    {{"id": string, "type": "door" | "crate" | "box" | "pillar", \

"keyframes": [{{"frame": int, "position": [x, y, z], "rotation_y": number, \
"action": "door_swing_open" | "spin" | "drive" | "flyover"}}]}}
  ],
  "props": [{{"id": string, "type": {_PROP_TYPES}, "position": [x, y, z], \
"scale": number, "rotation_y": number, "keyframes": [{{"frame": int, \
"position": [x, y, z], "rotation": [rx, ry, rz] in degrees, "scale": number}}]}}],
  "environment": [{{"id": string, "type": {_ENVIRONMENT_TYPES}, \
"position": [x, y, z], "scale": number, "rotation_y": number, "keyframes": [ \
{{"frame": int, "position": [x, y, z], "rotation": [rx, ry, rz] in degrees, \
"scale": number}}]}}],
  "cameras": [

  ],
  "shots": [{{"id": string, "camera": string, "start_frame": int, \
"end_frame": int, "description": string}}],
  "speech_bindings": []
}}

Props and environment objects move the same way: "keyframes" holds those \
frames and stays empty (or is omitted) for anything that never moves. A prop \
with keyframes moves along them, and its "position"/"rotation_y" become its \
rest pose — a keyframe overrides them while that frame is current. Use \
"rotation", the full [x, y, z] triple in degrees, for anything that turns on \
its own axis: a wheel turns about a horizontal axis, which "rotation_y" \
cannot express. A keyframe whose "frame" is past the scene's total frames \
(round(scene.duration * scene.frame_rate)) is rejected, and so is a prop that \
is both held_by a character and keyframed — a held item's position comes from \
that character's hand, so it cannot also be animated.

Hard rules:
- At least one camera and one shot. The shot's "camera" must equal a camera id.
- Every character and camera must have a keyframe at frame 0; add more \
keyframes for any described movement.
- Shot end_frame must equal round(scene.duration * scene.frame_rate) - 1.
- Positions are in meters. Z is UP: [x, y, z] is [right, forward, up]. \
Characters stand on the ground (z = 0); typical camera height is z = 1.6, \
2 to 20 meters from the subject.
- Place the camera so nothing stands between it and its subject, and so the \
subject is not a speck in the frame.
- Use 24 or 30 fps and keep duration between 2 and 10 seconds.
