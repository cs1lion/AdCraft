"""What each asset kind ACTUALLY measures, in metres.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
The renderer and the preview both scale a kind's geometry by the authored
``scale``, but nobody — including the model that writes the SceneScript — knows
what that product is in metres. A `pillar` at ``scale: 4.5`` is a 19 m column
beside a 1.85 m person; a `platform` at ``scale: 5`` is a 25 x 2 x 25 m slab whose
top sits at z = 3 m, which puts every character (authored at z = 0) UNDERNEATH
it. That is not a taste problem: with 5 of 8 camera positions inside that slab,
the rendered frame is a flat brown wall and no amount of camera work fixes it.

None of it was noticed until the preview's camera actually moved
(`docs/plans/threejs-renderer-replacement.md` §6). Renders used to come out blank,
so these numbers were never checked. They are what the LLM wrote blind, under a
prompt that described the JSON shape and said nothing about size.

THE TABLE IS A MIRROR, NOT A SOURCE
The geometry itself lives in ``apps/web/src/features/agent-canvas/canvas/
sceneScriptGeometry.tsx``. This table is transcribed from it, and the two are held
together by ``sceneScriptGeometry.dimensions.test.ts``, which mounts every kind
and MEASURES the rendered bounding box rather than parsing the JSX. So an
error here fails a test instead of shipping a wrong number into a prompt.

Measurements are SceneScript space: metres, Z-up, at ``scale = 1``:

    width   extent along x (right)
    height  extent along z (up), from the ground
    depth   extent along y (forward)
    base    how far the geometry's underside floats above z = 0

``base`` is the field that hides the worst bug: a geometry whose ``base`` is
positive is a floating slab, and anything authored on the ground at z = 0 ends up
underneath it.
